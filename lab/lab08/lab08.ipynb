    "In World War II, the Allies (led by the US, the UK, and the Soviet Union) wanted to know how many military tanks the Germans had produced. However, they didn't get to see every single tank produced by the Germans ‚Äì rather, all they saw was a random **sample** of tanks, and they wanted to use this sample to estimate the total number of tanks produced by the Germans. This problem, known as the [German tank problem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/German_tank_problem), is a famous application of statistical estimation in a real-world scenario.\n",
    "\n",
    "To frame the problem more precisely, consider that tanks were given serial numbers ranging from 1 to `N`, where `N` was the total number of tanks produced. The Allies were trying to estimate `N`, a **population parameter**, using the serial numbers of the tanks in their sample. We will assume that the Allies' sample is a simple random sample of the population (drawn without replacement).\n",

    "\n",
    "In this lab, given **just** a random sample of serial numbers, we'll estimate `N`, and then we'll use simulation to find out how accurate our estimate likely is, without ever looking at the whole population. This is an example of **statistical inference** - inferring something about a population using just the information in a sample.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Note:** As you continue to learn about Data Science and other related subjects, it is important that you understand that a lot of advancements in technology related to these subjects have been funded through military budgets. In 2024, of the [United States Department of Defense's 841.4 billion dollar budget](https://www.defense.gov/News/Releases/Release/Article/3326875/department-of-defense-releases-the-presidents-fiscal-year-2024-defense-budget/#:~:text=The%20FY%202024%20budget%20request,credible%20forces%20across%20all%20domains.), 145 billion dollar were allocated for research, development, testing, and evaluation (the largest in history).  This awareness is important because there have been many times throughout history when those developing/learning about new technologies were unaware of their original intended use(s) or the context in which they were developed."
